# How to convert our existing code into OOP

* Create a class, maybe call it: `Pets`
* Three Methods? (maybe?)
  * `feed_pet`
  * `play_with_pet`
  * `get_hungry_and_mopey`
* Two Class Attributes (maybe more/maybe Instance?)
  * `fullness`
  * `happiness`
* Instance Attribute (at least one, maybe more?)
  * `name`
* `def __init__` - `self` and `name`, maybe more?
